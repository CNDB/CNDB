  * bssid:

    + dependent on Wireless_Mode ???

    + is it needed ??? (or is `ssid` sufficient)

  * distance ???

- Router: other name?

- Network topology: explicit vs. implicit

  * e.g.: FFM.Node

- runs_version_id: not in Device,

  --> Router_runs_Firmware

- authentificationtoken: not in Device,

  --> Router

- XXX uses Antenna

- SQL integrity constraints for interval arithmetic (IP networks)

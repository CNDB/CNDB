Open questions
===============

When referring to CNML we mean the XML format exported by guifi.net,
there are no other implementations of CNML we're aware of.

- General attributes

  * CNML has creation date and update-date, we're ignoring these in the
    first prototype but when importing, these should probably be kept
    (e.g. for a migration use-case)

  * CNML seems to have a verbose description between ``<node>`` and
    ``</node>``

  * Devices, Nodes and Links have a status in CNML (for link the
    attribute is called ``link_status``) with the values
    ``Building``, ``Reserved``, ``Working``, ``Testing``, ``Planned``,
    ``Dropped``, I've found no link with status ``Dropped``

- Zone

  * ``Node_in_Zone`` or ``Net_Interface_in_Zone``? We might have
    gateways that are in different zones, i.e., the gateway node is in
    several zones while each interface is in just one zone.

  * Are zones also routing-relevant or do we need a separate
    routing-zone?

  * hierarchical zones? CNML format has hierarchical zones.

  * CNML has rectangular zones with a bounding box with two points
    lat/lon, we don't think this makes much sense.

  * CNML has a timezone with a peculiar format ``+01 2 2``

    + do we need that at all?
    + better would be a timezone name (summertime!)

- Wireless_Interface (aka Radio)

  * specification of channel(s)

  * bssid:

    + dependent on Wireless_Mode ?
    + is it needed? (or is `ssid` sufficient)

  * distance to/from node?

- Devices vs. composite devices

  * Devices in CNML (e.g. radio) have a title *and* a name, e.g.
    title: ``AleMasnou12Rd1``, name: ``NanoStation Loco2``, on closer
    examination the name attribute seems to denote the device type

  * Radios in CNML are devices and have antenna parameters, we model
    this differently (imho more correctly)
  
  * So it probably makes sense to combine the radio name + title and use
    both names for device + interface

- Network topology: explicit vs. implicit

- interfacetype: used for TABLE interfaces, not defined

- macprotocol: what for?

  --> Net_Interface

- Antenna parameters:

  * CNML has ``antenna_angle`` which seems to be the german term
    Öffnungswinkel, correct english term? Maybe we should aim to get
    radiation diagrams for all antennae, we want to model this with
    radio mobile. Todo: Use this parameter from CNML

To-Do
=====

- improve docstrings

  * e.g.: FFM.Node

- runs_version_id: not in Device,

  --> Net_Device_runs_Firmware

- authentification token: not in Device,

  --> Net_Device

- SQL integrity constraints for interval arithmetic (IP networks)

  * how to put most of the check into SQL

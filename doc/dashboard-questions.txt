Questions about dashboard structure and behavior
=================================================

- Login/logout

  * Separate landing page, dashboard only visible when logged in?

  * CSRF protection for login

    + needs a short-lived Anti-CRSF-token

    + problem with login-form embedded in landing page

    + problem with JS-apps based on the REST API

      - server needs an explicit list of authorized domains for such
        JS apps

      - otherwise, CSRF is wide open

  * How long should a user stay logged in?

- Interaction

  * Dashboard starts with overview of nodes controlled, i.e., owned or
    managed, by the person who is logged in

    Three possible actions:

    + Create a new node (very important for a new user): Mihis design
      doesn't have a button for that

      - Is the form to create a new node meant to be open below the
        node list?

      - If so, where does it go when the user decides to take one of
        the other actions?

    + Edit an existing node

    + Display list of devices for a specific node

    + If one of those actions is taken by the user,
      `div.node-details` changes content:

      - Should the node table stay visible?

      - If so, should the active node be visually marked?

      - If the new content is a form (create, edit), should the action
        buttons disabled?

        * If not, clicking another action button during interaction
          with the form can easily result in loss of data

  * When the device table is shown:

    + Does the node table stay visible?

    + What happens when the user chooses to display details for one
      device?

      - Is the interface table appended to the page?

      - Are outer parts visible or hidden?

      - If outer parts are visible, the number of possible actions
        increases drastically

    + Recurse for showing details about a specific interface...

  * If out layers are not shown, some way of navigating back/up is
    necessary

    + Some kind of breadcrumbs, too

- Navigation

  * Mihis design:

    + 4 links at top: dashboard, home, about, contact

    + what is the meaning of the `dashboard` link?

    + what is the meaning of the `home` link?

  * Put `about` and `contact` into `footer`?

  * Page for `impressum` is legally necessary, the copyright in the
    footer should link to that.

    + Could save link to `contact`

    + Or `contact` could be a mailto: link

  * Breadcrumbs for position in dashboard ?

  * Nav button to show detailed navigation ?

- I18N/L10N ?

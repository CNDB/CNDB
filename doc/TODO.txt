Rename FFM to nodedb ("NDB"?) because it is actually a more common thing not just FF

generalize wireless interface?


steps on the critical path
==========================
* We have a pool of IP addresses. Write IP address allocator for FF
  define ranges for IP addresses. housing is one zone, freenet another
  zone, CONFINE a third zone
  IP-Pools are associated with a Zone (or Routing Zone ?)
* Generate DNS zone files for DNS <-> IP address matching. 
Forward und reverse zone
AI: Aaron gives sample DNS Bind zone files.
AI: Aaron gives sample DNS server for testing
AI: Ralf -> fill in the template files

We must be able to assign IP addresses to CONFINE nodes/devices

* simple initial monitoring:
Generate smokeping template files. 
AI: aaron gives sample
AI: Ralf: generate files based on sample. Try it out with smokeping on a server for all of FF ip addresses.
Compare with marvin smokeping

* Integration with SFA:
  SFA needs to know the REST API. This must be described, understood by the ppl in Barcelona and they must
be able to query and insert and delete (CRUD) values into the nodeDB. 
Barcelona has access to a test playground DB (ffm.gg32?)
Deadline: begining Sept.

* Generate simple user interface a la Django for editing nodes, devices, IP addresses, add and edit users, etc.
CRUD services
